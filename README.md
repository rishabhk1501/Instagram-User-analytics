# Instagram-User-analytics
Our project is aimed at tracking Instagram user engagement patterns that ultimately helps us shape marketing campaigns, create new feature prospects and minimize dummy/fake account creation.
## Insights generated

● 5 most oldest consumers found can be rewarded by providing them tools such
as priority badges, live connect with Instagram team etc.
● People who have not posted any photo should be given frequent notifications
and emails.
● Posts from 5 most used hashtags should be promoted in recommended section
to increase engagement.
● There is higher chance of user registration on Thursdays and Sundays, So Ad
campaigns of major clients who are contributing more to the ad revenue should
be given priority on these days and featured more.
● Strict action should be taken against bot accounts, Instagram should find a way
to block these accounts at source, and frequently remind consumers to be
aware from prospected bot accounts
